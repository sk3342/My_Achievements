Perfectly described about what I have done here for BAseball Analysis for portfolio project

Here are some abbreviations/definitions to understand the game and what are factors(attributes) of player and stats about the game play.

ABS (At_Bat) = At-Bats count the number of times a batter officially bats, excluding walks, hit-by-pitches, sacrifices, and certain other events.
Whiff (swing and miss) : Occurs when a batter swings and misses.
Takes (no_swing) : Occurs when a batter chooses not to swing at a pitch.
Spin Rate : Spin rate measures the revolutions per minute (RPM) of a baseball as it spins around its axis while in flight. It indicates how quickly the ball rotates and is typically measured using advanced tracking technology like Statcast.
Hits :  Hits represent the number of times a batter safely reaches base due to their batting performance.
WOBA (weight on batting average) : Calculates a player's offensive value by assigning weights to different outcomes, such as walks, singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, based on their impact on scoring runs.
BABIP (Batting avg on balls in play) : measures how often a ball in play goes for a hit, excluding home runs and strikeouts. It reflects a player's ability to get hits from balls they hit into the field of play and is often used to analyze luck and skill.
Slugging_power (SLG) : measures the total number of bases a player records per at-bat. Unlike Batting Average (BA), which only considers hits, SLG accounts for the power of those hits by giving more weight to extra-base hits (doubles, triples, and home runs).
Batting_average (BA) : is a measure of how often a player gets a hit per at-bat. It is one of the oldest and most traditional baseball statistics
Isolated_power (ISO) : measures a player's raw power and ability to hit for extra bases. It essentially quantifies how good a player is at hitting doubles, triples, and home runs.
Expected Batting average (xBA) : predicts a player's expected batting average based on the quality of contact they make with the ball. It uses similar principles as xwOBA but focuses specifically on the likelihood of each batted ball resulting in a hit.
Expected weight on batting average (xwOBA) : measures a player's expected on-base ability based on the exit velocity and launch angle of their batted balls. It calculates the expected outcome (weighted on-base average) for each batted ball event, such as hits, walks, or outs, and then aggregates these to provide an overall expected on-base average.
Launch speed : refers to the speed of the baseball after it is hit by a batter.
Velocity : in the context of pitching, refers to the speed of the baseball as it travels toward home plate from the pitcher's hand.
Effective speed : is a metric that takes into account not only the actual velocity of a pitch but also factors such as movement, spin rate, and release point. It provides a more comprehensive measure of how difficult the pitch is for hitters to track and hit.
Effective minimum velocity : refers to the lowest velocity threshold at which a pitcher's pitches are effective in terms of inducing swings and misses, weak contact, or favorable outcomes.
"Pos3_int_start_distance" and "pos4_int_start_distance" : appear to be terms related to positional data or measurements in a sport context, likely indicating the initial or intermediate distances of players from specific points on the field.
